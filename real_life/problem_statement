<!--========================================== ðŸš€ BASIC PROBLEMS ========================================================-->

1. Responsive Navigation Menu:
Build a navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. Include a mobile-friendly toggle button (hamburger menu) using JavaScript.

2. Form Validation:
Create a form (e.g., login, registration) and validate input fields in real-time using JavaScriptâ€”check for required fields, valid email formats, and password length.

3. Theme Toggle (Dark/Light Mode):
Allow users to switch between dark and light themes. Store the userâ€™s preference in localStorage and apply the theme using class toggling or CSS variables.

4. Countdown Timer / Stopwatch:
Create a digital countdown timer or stopwatch. Use setInterval() to track time and update the display every second.

5. Interactive FAQ Accordion:
Make an FAQ section where clicking a question reveals the answer while hiding others. Use JavaScript to toggle visibility and CSS for smooth animations.

6. Character or Word Counter:
Build a simple text input that counts characters or words in real-time. Display a live count below the text field and warn if a limit is exceeded.

7. Simple Image Slider:
Create a slider that allows users to go through images using next/prev buttons. Apply basic transitions and keep track of the current image index.

8. Tooltip on Hover:
Implement a tooltip that appears when the user hovers over an element. Use CSS for visibility and transitions, and optionally JavaScript for positioning.

9. Number Guessing Game:
Make a small game where users guess a number and get feedback on whether itâ€™s too high, too low, or correct. Include a reset button and use basic JavaScript logic.

10. Scroll to Top Button:
Add a button that appears when the user scrolls down the page. When clicked, it smoothly scrolls the user back to the top using JavaScript and CSS.

<!--========================================== ðŸ’¡ ADVANCED PROBLEMS ========================================================-->


1. Drag and Drop File Upload:
Create a file upload area where users can drag and drop files. Show a preview or file name, and optionally validate file types or sizes using JavaScript.

2. To-Do List with Local Storage:
Build a to-do list app where users can add, complete, delete tasks. Store the tasks in localStorage so they persist between sessions.

3. Interactive Image Gallery with Modal:
Display a gallery of thumbnails. When clicked, open the image in a modal with next/prev buttons. Handle keyboard and click events to navigate or close.

4. Real-Time Search Filter:
Display a list of items (users, products, etc.) and filter them as the user types in a search box. Use JavaScript to filter and display matching items instantly.

5. Responsive Dashboard with Charts:
Build a dashboard layout using CSS Grid/Flexbox. Integrate a charting library (like Chart.js) to show data visualizations such as bar or pie charts.

6. Infinite Scrolling News Feed:
Load and append content automatically as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page. Use JavaScript to detect scroll position and fetch new content.

7. Interactive Product Comparison Table:
Let users select multiple products and compare their features in a table. Use JavaScript to dynamically build the table based on user selection.

8. Form Submission with AJAX:
Submit a form using fetch() or XMLHttpRequest without reloading the page. Show loading states and display server responses dynamically.

9. Implementing Search and Filtering:
For a large dataset, build a frontend interface that supports search and filtering (by category, price, etc.). Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM and data.

10. Drag and Drop Functionality:
Enable drag-and-drop for reordering items in a list or moving them between containers. Use the Drag and Drop API and manage state with JavaScript.

11. Lazy Loading:
Improve page performance by loading images only when theyâ€™re visible in the viewport. Use loading="lazy" or JavaScript with Intersection Observer API.

<!--========================================== ðŸ”¥ EXPERT PROBLEMS ========================================================-->



1. Custom Audio/Video Player:
Create a media player from scratch using the HTML5 <audio> or <video> API. Add play/pause, seek, volume control, and custom UI elements.

2. Geolocation-Based Service Locator:
Use the Geolocation API to detect the user's location and show nearby services on a map (Google Maps or Leaflet). Handle permissions and display markers dynamically.

3. Dynamic Form Builder:
Let users drag and drop fields to create a form. Render the form dynamically in the DOM and serialize the configuration to save or reuse later.

4. Accessibility-Focused Autocomplete Input:
Build an input field with autocomplete suggestions. Support keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility (ARIA roles), and focus handling.

5. Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor (Simplified):
Build a text editor that supports basic real-time collaboration using simulated client-side logic. Handle concurrent edits, cursors, and syncing.

6. Creating Data Visualizations:
Use a library like D3.js to create interactive and customizable charts. Load and transform data dynamically, and allow user interaction (e.g., hover, zoom).

7. Single-Page Application (SPA) Development:
Build a full SPA using a frontend framework (like React/Vue). Implement routing, state management, and component-based architecture.

8. Customizable Image Cropper:
Create a tool that allows users to crop an image using mouse gestures. Use Canvas or SVG to show the cropped result in real time.

9. Progressive Web App (PWA) Offline Indicator:
Build a PWA that works offline using a Service Worker. Show a visual indicator when the app is offline and sync data when back online.
